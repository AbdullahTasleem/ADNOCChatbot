FLOW DIAGRAM

This is the flow diagram that our chatbot follows. Although this is a much more simplistic version of how it will work, this is the basic concept it follows. With regards to mainly the queries and routes the user will go through when going through D-NA, this flow diagram helps establish what the chatbot is programmed to answer at a specific time.
